# 💾 SESSION 7 - INTRO TO FEATURE ENGINEERING AND MODEL THINKING

Week 4 Session 7 focuses on feature engineering, Preprocessing and Model Thinking - Preparing datasets for future machine learning 

## 📌 Session Coverage

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Creating new features from existing data
- Date-based and aggregation features
- Feature selection (keeping relevant features, dropping unnecessary ones)
- Understanding the impact of features on model performance

### 🔹 Encoding & Scaling
- Identifying categorical and numerical features

- When and why to encode categorical variables

- When and why to scale numerical features

- Common techniques:

- One-hot encoding
- Standard scaling
- Min-max scaling
- Importance of preprocessing before modeling

### 🔹 Introduction to Model Thinking
- Understanding supervised vs unsupervised learning

- Identifying types of target variables:

- Regression
- Binary classification
- Multiclass classification
- Matching datasets to problem types

- Thinking about models conceptually before training

### 🔹 Pipelines (Conceptual)
- Organizing preprocessing steps in a structured workflow
- Avoiding common mistakes
- Preparing for future model training

## Mini Project
### 📌 Project Structure
This mini project has two parts:

Part 1: Practice on the dataset you've been working on

Part 2: Apply skills to a brand-new dataset

🔹 Part 1 — Feature Engineering & Model Thinking (Practice)
Dataset

🏪 Warehouse and Retail Sales – Montgomery County

You have already:

Cleaned the dataset

Handled missing values

Parsed dates

Performed EDA and visualization

This part focuses on the next stage of the data science workflow.

🎯 Tasks (Part 1)

Feature Engineering

Create at least 3 new meaningful features

Examples:

Date-based features (day, month, year)

Aggregated features (e.g. total sales per category)

Encoding Decisions

Identify which columns need encoding

State the type of encoding you would use and why (No need to implement the code)

Scaling Decisions

Identify which numerical features may need scaling.
Model Thinking

Identify a suitable target variable

State the problem type and explain your reasoning in 3–5 sentences

## 📌 Project Solution

### Part 1:
- Feature Engineering was already performed on the data set during data cleaning

Columns that need encoding:
